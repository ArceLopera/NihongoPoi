## What is Onomatopoeia?

Onomatopoeia are any words, expressions or phrases that aim to imitate or recreate a sound or feeling. Sounds like “moo moo” for a cow, or “vroom vroom” for a car. Japanese takes this to a whole new level, though. In Japanese, the onomatopoeia have a lot of nuance to express sounds of animals, nature, and inanimate objects, as well as feelings and movement. The five types of Japanese onomatopoeia are:

1. [**Giongo  - 擬音語**](#擬音語---inanimate-sound-effects-giongo): Sounds made by non-living things, like cars or the wind.
2. [**Gitaigo - 擬態語**](#擬態語---states-or-conditions-gitaigo): Sounds that describe states of being, like feeling sticky with sweat or muggy weather.
3. [**Giseigo - 擬声語**](#擬声語---animal-sound-effects-giseigo): Sounds from living things, like animals and people.
4. [**Giyougo - 擬容語**](#擬容語---movement-giyougo): Sounds that express descriptive movement that we would normally think of as verbs in English. Expressions like falling into deep sleep or walking around without purpose.
5. [**Gijougo - 擬情語**](#擬情語---emotions-and-feelings-gijougo): Describe feelings, like a shiver down your spine when you get an eerie feeling.

Giseigo and giongo are just like onomatopoeia we have in English. The cow goes moo. The machine is whirring. They represent real sounds you can hear. The other three describe what's called mimetic words, or ideophones. They describe or represent something that has no sound. The way you feel, the way you walk, and even your skin has an onomatopoeia to describe it. These mimetic words don't really exist in English, which makes mastering them difficult when learning Japanese.

## Formation

Japanese onomatopoeic expressions have several grammatical forms:

+ **Double form - Reduplication**: 
    わくわく (wakuwaku, excited), ぺらぺら (perapera, fluently speaking). This form expresses a continuing state of the sound or feeling, like how you speak fluently the whole time you have a conversation, or you feel excited for quite a while. When it’s doubled and the vowel is lengthened, it means the sound drags on, like グーグー (gu- gu-, snoring). The reduplication of a sound symbolizes repetition in sound or action. In Japanese this is called jougo <ruby>畳<rt>じょう</rt>語<rt>ご</rt></ruby>. You've probably seen this in other places in Japanese with the iteration mark 々 in words like: sometimes <ruby>時<rt>とき</rt>々<rt>どき</rt></ruby>, various <ruby>色<rt>いろ</rt>々<rt>いろ</rt></ruby> and people kanji <ruby>人<rt>ひと</rt>々<rt>びと</rt></ruby>. In onomatopoeia they usually refer to something that's happening over and over.


|Japanese|	English|
| --- | --- |
|ばらばら|	　heavy rain drops or hail coming down|
|わさわさ|	　grass and leaves rustling in the wind|
|ごぼごぼ|	　gushing water|
|だだだだ|	　something running at full speed|
|ごろごろ|	　something rolling loudly or heavily|


+ **と form - Ending in っ (+ と)**: 
   はっと (hatto, gasp), ぞっと (zotto, shivers down your spine). This form expresses a sound that is short, quick, and cut off. Like how a gasp comes out quickly or the shivers down your spine last only a second. Although the rules of Japanese state that all sounds must end in a vowel (expect ん) because of the syllabary nature of the language, onomatopoeia are often pronounced with an abrupt stop. This is expressed in written language with a っ and is called a glottal stop. This is what we call a sound made by stopping air in your glottis (it's in your throat). The best way to hear it in English is to say "uh-uh." Some of these will be followed by the particle と in a sentence (but not all of them!). They usually refer to a sound that stopped suddenly or abruptly.

|Japanese|	English|
| --- | --- |
|ごくっ|	gulp|
|げっ|	vomiting or gagging|
|かっ|	coughing up something|
|ぼーっ|	a flame flaring up suddenly|
|がばっ|	suddenly waking up|

+ [**り form - Ending in り**](goiN3.md): 
   のそり (nosori, to walk lazily), しょんぼり (shonbori, crestfallen, dejected). り form is used when the sound or action is slow and drawn out. It’s the opposite of と form, like how you walk slowly or feel dejected for a while. The onomatopoeia form ending in り conveys a feeling of softness or slowness. It's basically the opposite of a glottal stop. It's something long, or deliberate, not short or abrupt.

|Japanese|	English|
| --- | --- |
|ぽっちゃり|chubby|
|のらりのらり|	wander around aimlessly|
|じゃくり|	scooping something like sand|
|ほっかり|	warm breath or steam|
|のそり|	moving slowly and sluggishly|

+ **Ending in ん**:
   Onomatopoeia that end in ん are pronounced with a nasal sound, producing a feeling of "prolonged resonance" or rhythm. If something is echoing or ringing it will usually end in ん. When describing a state of being, not a sound, it usually means something that's continuous.

|Japanese|	English|
| --- | --- |
|ごほん|	a strong cough|
|こんこん|	something hitting something else over and over|
|しん|	cold deeply penetrating your body|
|じゃぶん|	strong bubbling|
|ぼーん|	an explosive fire bursting into flames|

+ **Long Vowels**:
    Words that end in long vowels refer to a sense of continuation or longness. Something is happening and it's happening for a long time.

|Japanese|	English|
| --- | --- |
|ふわ～|	a long yawn|
|ぐーぐー|	loud snoring|
|ざーざー|	heavy, continuous pouring rain|
|ちゅーちゅー|	drinking something down little by little|
|のーのー|	enjoying yourself without caring about what's around you|

## Usage 
### Adverbs + と
When paired with と before a verb, they become an adverb.

### に (ni) before a verb

### into a verb with やる (yaru) or する (suru)

## Consonants

Most Japanese syllables start with a consonant. Because the Japanese alphabet is extremely kind, it's (mostly) phonetic. This means that each sound is spelled exactly the way it is pronounced. And every written character is pronounced, unlike English, which has silent letters. Also, thanks to this, there are two neat little symbols called the dakuten and handakuten.

+ Dakuten 濁点 are two little dots, or lines, also called ten-ten.
+ Handakuten 半濁点 is the open circle, also called maru.

These symbols change the voicing of the consonants they're added to. Consonants can be voiced or unvoiced. Basically, voiced sounds are made with your vocal cords and unvoiced are made without. Here's what they look like in Japanese:

か > が

ka > ga

さ > ざ

sa > za

た > だ

ta > da

は > ば, は > ぱ

ha > ba, ha > pa

Sounds without these symbols are called seion 清音, meaning "pure sounds." Adding dakuten or handakuten make them dakuon 濁音, meaning "impure sounds." This is just the Japanese way of saying that an unvoiced sound is becoming voiced. That's also why the "han" in handakuten means half. Just think of it as being half as pure.

This voicing is very important for understanding onomatopoeia. There are lots of, what I'll call, sets, that represent different sounds based on their voiced and unvoiced counterpart. Let's look:

|Japanese|	English|
| -- | -- |
|こんこん|	knocking|
|ごんごん|　	banging|
|さらさら|	silky|
|ざらざら|	rough|
|とんとん|	tapping|
|どんどん|	drumming|
|はらはら|	fluttering|
|ばらばら|	rustling|
|ぱらぱら|	clattering|

The voiced version is always louder, heavier, and more intense than its unvoiced friend. That's probably what makes them seem "impure." Say these aloud and feel the difference.

Now, when you hear onomatopoeia, you can tell if it's something loud or strong based on what kind of consonant it has. Something using "loud" voiced consonants might be banging, rolling thunder, or strong feelings. Something "half" voiced will be noisy, but not loud, like the pitter patter of rain bouncing off of a window.

## Vowels
These are just as important as consonants. Changing a character from か to こ will change the type of sound it's representing, just like adding dakuten and handakuten. Let's take a look:

- かんかん　clear clanging
- きんきん　high pitched clanging
- こんこん　low pitched clanging

For the purpose of this example, these are all representing a clanging sound. Something hitting something else. かんかん is the sound of something hitting metal or stone. きんきん is the sound of a musical triangle. こんこん is the sound of something hitting something hard and echoey. Again, say them aloud. Hit some things too! See if you can tell what vowel would be used to express the sound you're hearing. Here's are some general rules from Jazz Up Your Japanese:

+ あ long, slow
+ い little, small, quick
+ う long, slow
+ え something negative (bad)
+ お long, slow
