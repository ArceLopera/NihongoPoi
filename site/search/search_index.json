Perhaps you are speaking to a friend, family member, or a friendly first-name-basis type of acquaintance. In these cases, we can imagine that the speaker and listener's personal space bubbles overlap like a Venn diagram, and an entire conversation can take place within their shared personal space.</p> <p>When \u3060 is used in casual conversations, it is frequently paired with conversational particles like \u3088 and \u306d.

(Translation by Megan Backus.)</p> <p>Yoshimoto mainly uses \u3060 style in this novel, but she switches to \u3067\u3059 style in the second sentence to make the reader feel as though the character is stepping out of the story momentarily to directly address the reader. This adds a feeling of sudden interaction with the reader, which is nearly impossible to reflect in the English translation.</p> <p>Authors use these style-mixing techniques in a range of creative writing genres, from essays and editorials to advertisements and newspaper columns. Even in expository writing such as textbooks, guide books, or blog posts, you may notice that style mixing is used to make the writing more impactful and engaging.</p>"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#social-media-posts","title":"SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS","text":"<p>In fact, most native Japanese speakers use style mixture to some extent, and social media posts are a great example of this. \u6628\u65e5\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3067\u3059</p> <p>\u6e80\u958b\u306e\u82b1\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u30fc Here's a picture of a rhododendron that I took yesterday.

This, though, is keeping in mind mediums such as very formal speech where this grammar structure is seen in the spoken language. As this is mainly \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, the frequency of any verb in this is determined by the refinement and formality of the language used.

July 19th, 4:20 It has been found out through police investigation that in the case in which a 16 year old girl and 6 men and women acquaintances from Hiroshima City were arrested for the abandonment of the body of a former classmate in the mountains of Hiroshima Prefecture Kure City, a group of 7 people inside a car towards the mountainside suppressed the former classmate, and repeatedly assaulted her. The police are furthering investigation into the suspicion that [the group] had taken the former student into the car with plans to assault her from the beginning.       This month on the 14th, a 16 year old girl who surrendered herself to police for the abandonment of the body in the mountains of Hiroshima Prefecture Kure City of a former 16 year old female student at [their] vocational high school was arrested, and on the 17th, unemployed 21 year old resident of Tottori Prefecture Yurihama Town Seto Ohira and 5 unemployed 16 year old men and women were arrested for suspicion in the body abandonment. Suspect Ohira denies claims from the police, but the 6 others have confessed. In investigation up to now, it\u2019s understood that the 7 people are testifying that they put the former classmate into the vehicle, went to the scene in the mountains, and after getting off the vehicle, they group assaulted [her], and the police on the 18th seized the car thought to be used. In police investigation afterward, it has been found out from reports to the police that the group of 7 suppressed the former classmate inside the car towards the scene and repeatedly assaulted her by beating and kicking her.
