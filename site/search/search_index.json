Japanese writing can be divided into two major styles, often called: \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style and \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059 shows engagement with social rules and therefore directs the writing specifically toward the reader. The \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can be equated with that of \u3060 in speaking, though its impact varies dramatically according to the level of formality. This fits in with the idea that \u3060 is \"raw\" and can therefore be used to show naked emotions and bare facts alike, without the sense of social etiquette that is part and parcel of \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. If we delve a little deeper, \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can also be broken down further into two distinct styles. With impeccable logic, these two styles are known as \u3060 style and\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u3067\u3042\u308b style. They are often treated as one and the same because they come under the umbrella of \u3060 for self-expression, implying a lack of focus on the audience. When we make \u3060 statements, we are stepping away from the need to perform in a socially calculated way, and instead we emphasize our personal thoughts and feelings. In other words, \u3060 statements allow us to avoid considering our relative social status compared to our listeners' because the statement is conceptually staying inside our personal space. In the safety of our bubble, \u3060 statements do not necessarily require a response. This enables us to devote all of our attention to self-expression. When it comes to actual writing styles, however, \u3060 style and \u3067\u3042\u308b style are usually considered separate as they carry different nuances. To put it simply, \u3060 is plain and \u3067\u3042\u308b is a bit more authoritative and formal. For that reason, \u3060 style is usually referred to as plain style, and \u3067\u3042\u308b style is referred to variously in textbooks as plain-formal, literary, or expository style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style remains one set, referred to as polite style. Examples of nuances: \u3060 FOR EMPHATIC SELF-EXPRESSION Statements that end in \u3060 can be used to express thoughts and feelings that arise suddenly or powerfully within us. These kinds of statements are self-directed, and thus we can imagine that they remain inside our personal space bubbles when we say them. Contrary to what you may have learned in textbooks, \u3060 is commonly used to express your inner state when speaking in the presence of someone to whom you'd usually use a more polite speech style like \u3067\u3059 and \u307e\u3059. This is because your use of \u3060 communicates that the purpose of the statement is self-expression and not actually directed at the listener, even if they are within earshot. \u3060 FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM There are some cases where it is not clear whether a \u3060 statement should be considered self-directed or directed at others. For these examples, we think it is useful to imagine that the speaker's personal space bubble has expanded to include the listeners inside of it. \u706b\u4e8b\u3060\uff01 \u3060 FOR INVADING PERSONAL SPACE When \u3060 statements that carry a negative emotion or message are directed at a specific listener, \u3060 adds an aggressive and assertive feeling. In this case, the listener may feel surprised, affronted, or threatened by the statement. For this reason, we refer to this use of \u3060 as \"invasive.\" \u3046\u305d\u3060\uff01 While this statement is clearly motivated by the actions of a particular person, the use of \u3060 suggests that the statement is not intended to engage the listener in discussion. While it is directed at the speaker in the sense that it is intended to have an impact, it is stripped of all feelings of social responsibility or concern for the other person's point of view. The purpose is to express the speaker's outrage, not to start a conversation. The one-sided nature of this statement is what gives it an assertive, or even confrontational, feeling. \u3060 IN CASUAL CONVERSATION While the uses of \u3060 we've discussed thus far seem to be directed at the speaker themselves, there are also cases where we use \u3060 statements that are clearly directed at others. In these cases, \u3060 is used because the listener is considered close enough to the speaker that their relative social statuses are not relevant or worth paying attention to by using \u3067\u3059. Perhaps you are speaking to a friend, family member, or a friendly first-name-basis type of acquaintance. In these cases, we can imagine that the speaker and listener's personal space bubbles overlap like a Venn diagram, and an entire conversation can take place within their shared personal space. When \u3060 is used in casual conversations, it is frequently paired with conversational particles like \u3088 and \u306d. Remember that when \u3060 is used alone it can convey a feeling of strong emotion? Well, our particle friends help to make the statement sound softer and more interactional. A: \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088\u3002(Hey, we have an exam tomorrow.) B: \u3048\uff01\uff1f( What!?) A: \u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u5fb9\u591c\u3060\u306d\u3002(It's gonna be an all-nighter for you.) For example, by saying \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088, you are reminding the listener of the test. If this is stated without the particle \u3088, this would sound more like a \u3060 statement intended to express the speaker's sudden remembrance of the test. Similarly, saying \u5fb9\u591c\u3060\u306d allows the speaker to show her empathy while suggesting the listener should study all night. Without the \u306d, this sentence would sound more like a strong command. \u3067\u3059 FOR CREATING DISTANCE using \u3067\u3059 increases the distance between people, which results in their relationship feeling more formal. \u3067\u3059 is part of the \"polite speech style\" in Japanese, along with the \u307e\u3059 form of verbs. This stands in opposition to the \"casual speech style,\" which \u3060 is considered to be a part of. Imagine that you are talking with your senpai at work. He might offer you permission to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3. The word \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3 consists of \u305f\u3081 (equal) and \u304f\u3061 (mouth), and is pronounced as \u305f\u3081\u3050\u3061. As the word suggests, using it indicates that the speaker and listener have equal status. If someone asks you to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3\u3000\u3000\u3050\u3061, it is likely that the person wants to be friends with you. Or \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3 can also be a sign of romantic interest. \u3067\u3059 FOR EMPHASIZING SARCASM When doing this with someone who is usually in your personal space bubble, the listener will feel ejected from the bubble, which can have a comedic, sarcastic effect but can also be perceived as rude or hurtful. Let's explore how this works in real life situations. Imagine a situation where you have a boyfriend who is bragging about getting a whole lot of chocolates from his colleagues on Valentine's Day. Instead of using your energy to complain about his lack of sensitivity, you can say the following sentence, keeping the tone of your voice low for effect. \u3078\u30fc\u3001\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u306d\u30fc\u3002 Saying this in a casual speech form would still communicate your true thoughts, which is that you're not happy about what he told you, if you manipulate the tone of your voice and facial expressions to show sarcasm. But the addition of \u3067\u3059, makes your boyfriend feel you are creating distance between the two of you, and this makes your statement sound even colder. Remember, \u3067\u3059 emphasizes distance and creates certain nuances only when you use it with someone who you normally talk to in casual speech style. \u3067\u3059 FOR STEPPING INTO A DIFFERENT SOCIAL ROLE Another way this distance affects our communication is that it allows speakers to step into a different social role. For example, teachers use polite speech style to address the whole class when talking about something that is relevant to everyone. When they talk to a specific student about something that is relevant only to that student, they are more likely to use casual speech. This is because what they say is more or less personal when they address particular students. When they address the whole class however, teachers tend to use \u3067\u3059 to show that they are now engaged in a social activity they are responsible for. In other words, teachers use \u3067\u3059 to signal that their focus is on the class, and they are well aware of their role as a teacher. ACADEMIC WRITING \u3067\u3042\u308b style is overwhelmingly employed in academic writing, particul arly in published research papers, theses, and dissertations. This is because the information under discussion is objective, rigorous, and intended to be persuasive, making the authoritative and formal tone of \u3067\u3042\u308b fitting in this kind of writing. The \u3067\u3042\u308b style can have a high-and-mighty connotation, so its use as base form is generally limited. So the choice of writing style is more about the text's content and intended audience. \u3067\u3042\u308b style is often used when the text is issued by some sort of authority, whereas plain old \u3060 style is for more neutral and lighter texts. Lighter academic writing exercises such as high school essays, on the other hand, tend to use \u3060 style instead. Official documents, such as government reports and policy documents, are also primarily written in \u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style is often associated with simple, easy-to-read instructions or guidelines addressing the reader directly. So even in formal writing, if information is portrayed as being directed toward the reader, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style will almost always be favored. NEWS MEDIA The purpose of news media is to convey information in a purely objective manner without the sense that this information carries authority. Here, \u3060 style is usually preferred over \u3067\u3042\u308b style to reflect the ideal that journalists should maintain a neutral voice in their writing, rather than trying to persuade the reader of their point of view. In editorials and other pieces that are addressing the reader directly, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style can be used. Other styles, including \u3067\u3042\u308b or very casual styles, can also be mixed in strategically to spice up writing and convey various nuances and different personas. Not all news media outlets follow these general principles, however. While most online newspapers use \u3060 style for fact reporting, NHK News Web has opted for \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. There are two possible reasons for this choice. Unlike newspapers, NHK doesn't have a print edition, and so it doesn't have to work within a limited space. That means they can freely address readers directly and politely by using \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 to make their articles more accessible and sound friendly. Another explanation could be that NHK is first and foremost a broadcaster, which might have influenced their choice of a more \"spoken\" style. CREATIVE WRITING Creative writers tend to select one style as the prominent voice in their writing. However, they can intentionally mix in other styles to add different effects. The following is an excerpt from Banana Yoshimoto's critically acclaimed novel, Kitchen. \u3057\u3093\u3068\u6697\u304f\u3001\u306a\u306b\u3082\u606f\u3065\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u898b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306f\u305a\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3001\u307e\u308b\u3067\u305d\u3063\u307d\u3092\u3080\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u3088\u308a\u306f\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3068\u544a\u3052\u3066\u629c\u304d\u8db3\u3067\u5165\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002 Cold and dark, not a sigh to be heard. Everything there, which should have been so familiar, seemed to be turning away from me. I entered gingerly, on tiptoe, feeling as though I should ask permission. (Translation by Megan Backus.) Yoshimoto mainly uses \u3060 style in this novel, but she switches to \u3067\u3059 style in the second sentence to make the reader feel as though the character is stepping out of the story momentarily to directly address the reader. This adds a feeling of sudden interaction with the reader, which is nearly impossible to reflect in the English translation. Authors use these style-mixing techniques in a range of creative writing genres, from essays and editorials to advertisements and newspaper columns. Even in expository writing such as textbooks, guide books, or blog posts, you may notice that style mixing is used to make the writing more impactful and engaging. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS In fact, most native Japanese speakers use style mixture to some extent, and social media posts are a great example of this. \u6628\u65e5\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3067\u3059 \u6e80\u958b\u306e\u82b1\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u30fc Here's a picture of a rhododendron that I took yesterday. Flowers in full bloom really are beautiful! The first sentence introduces the topic and tells the account's followers what is in the attached picture. Then, in the second sentence, the style switches to casual to express the writer's inner thoughts, admiring the beauty of the flowers in full bloom. Social media posts are often loaded with style mixing, as people can freely weave their thoughts in a message to their followers. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059\u4f53 \u3060\u4f53 \u3067\u3042\u308b\u4f53 (\u306f\u304c\u304d\u3001\u3066\u304c\u307f) (\u65e5\u8a18) (\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u8a08\u753b\u66f8\u3001\u8ad6\u6587) \u540d\u8a5e \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059 \u5b66\u751f\u3060 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3042\u308b \u306a\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3057\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3060\u3063\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u3044\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \u5927\u304d\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u3044 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u3044 \u5927\u304d\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304b\u3063\u305f \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u52d5\u8a5e \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3059 \u66f8\u304f \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093 \u66f8\u304b\u306a\u3044 \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f \u66f8\u3044\u305f \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f \u66f8\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u305d\u306e\u307b\u304b\u306e\u3001\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u5f62 \u8aac\u660e\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046 \u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3088\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u308d\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308d\u3046 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3060 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b \u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u6559\u3048\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044 Basic concepts of \u3067\u3059 as socially-oriented and \u3060 as self-oriented have remained consistent throughout. The effect that these concepts have on communication can vary depending on context, but underneath it all, their basic meaning remains the same. If the message is self-directed and your main purpose is expressing your thoughts or feelings, then \u3060 is your ticket. If your message is directed toward others and you intend to present information in a socially aware manner, then \u3067\u3059 is probably preferred. Based on Tofugo blogpost","title":"\u3067\u3059\u30fc\u307e\u3059VS\u3060\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#vs-style","text":"Objective: Find out the difference in writing style. Japanese writing can be divided into two major styles, often called: \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style and \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059 shows engagement with social rules and therefore directs the writing specifically toward the reader. The \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can be equated with that of \u3060 in speaking, though its impact varies dramatically according to the level of formality. This fits in with the idea that \u3060 is \"raw\" and can therefore be used to show naked emotions and bare facts alike, without the sense of social etiquette that is part and parcel of \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. If we delve a little deeper, \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can also be broken down further into two distinct styles. With impeccable logic, these two styles are known as \u3060 style and\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u3067\u3042\u308b style. They are often treated as one and the same because they come under the umbrella of \u3060 for self-expression, implying a lack of focus on the audience. When we make \u3060 statements, we are stepping away from the need to perform in a socially calculated way, and instead we emphasize our personal thoughts and feelings. In other words, \u3060 statements allow us to avoid considering our relative social status compared to our listeners' because the statement is conceptually staying inside our personal space. In the safety of our bubble, \u3060 statements do not necessarily require a response. This enables us to devote all of our attention to self-expression. When it comes to actual writing styles, however, \u3060 style and \u3067\u3042\u308b style are usually considered separate as they carry different nuances. To put it simply, \u3060 is plain and \u3067\u3042\u308b is a bit more authoritative and formal. For that reason, \u3060 style is usually referred to as plain style, and \u3067\u3042\u308b style is referred to variously in textbooks as plain-formal, literary, or expository style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style remains one set, referred to as polite style.","title":"\u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 vs \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style\uff08\u6587\u4f53\uff09"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#examples-of-nuances","text":"","title":"Examples of nuances:"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#for-emphatic-self-expression","text":"Statements that end in \u3060 can be used to express thoughts and feelings that arise suddenly or powerfully within us.

Official documents, such as government reports and policy documents, are also primarily written in \u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style is often associated with simple, easy-to-read instructions or guidelines addressing the reader directly. So even in formal writing, if information is portrayed as being directed toward the reader, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style will almost always be favored.","title":"ACADEMIC WRITING"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#news-media","text":"The purpose of news media is to convey information in a purely objective manner without the sense that this information carries authority. Here, \u3060 style is usually preferred over \u3067\u3042\u308b style to reflect the ideal that journalists should maintain a neutral voice in their writing, rather than trying to persuade the reader of their point of view. In editorials and other pieces that are addressing the reader directly, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style can be used. Other styles, including \u3067\u3042\u308b or very casual styles, can also be mixed in strategically to spice up writing and convey various nuances and different personas. Not all news media outlets follow these general principles, however. While most online newspapers use \u3060 style for fact reporting, NHK News Web has opted for \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. There are two possible reasons for this choice. Unlike newspapers, NHK doesn't have a print edition, and so it doesn't have to work within a limited space. That means they can freely address readers directly and politely by using \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 to make their articles more accessible and sound friendly. Another explanation could be that NHK is first and foremost a broadcaster, which might have influenced their choice of a more \"spoken\" style.","title":"NEWS MEDIA"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#creative-writing","text":"Creative writers tend to select one style as the prominent voice in their writing. However, they can intentionally mix in other styles to add different effects. The following is an excerpt from Banana Yoshimoto's critically acclaimed novel, Kitchen. \u3057\u3093\u3068\u6697\u304f\u3001\u306a\u306b\u3082\u606f\u3065\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u898b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306f\u305a\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3001\u307e\u308b\u3067\u305d\u3063\u307d\u3092\u3080\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u3088\u308a\u306f\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3068\u544a\u3052\u3066\u629c\u304d\u8db3\u3067\u5165\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002 Cold and dark, not a sigh to be heard. Everything there, which should have been so familiar, seemed to be turning away from me. I entered gingerly, on tiptoe, feeling as though I should ask permission. (Translation by Megan Backus.) Yoshimoto mainly uses \u3060 style in this novel, but she switches to \u3067\u3059 style in the second sentence to make the reader feel as though the character is stepping out of the story momentarily to directly address the reader. This adds a feeling of sudden interaction with the reader, which is nearly impossible to reflect in the English translation. Authors use these style-mixing techniques in a range of creative writing genres, from essays and editorials to advertisements and newspaper columns. Even in expository writing such as textbooks, guide books, or blog posts, you may notice that style mixing is used to make the writing more impactful and engaging.","title":"CREATIVE WRITING"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#social-media-posts","text":"In fact, most native Japanese speakers use style mixture to some extent, and social media posts are a great example of this. \u6628\u65e5\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3067\u3059 \u6e80\u958b\u306e\u82b1\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u30fc Here's a picture of a rhododendron that I took yesterday.

From \u53cb\u60c5 by \u6b66\u8005\u5c0f\u8def\u5b9f\u7be4. Though more common in literature, due to the fact that they are two more verbs, \u898b\u308b, \u5bdd\u308b, and \u6765\u308b are not near as common in this. This, though, is keeping in mind mediums such as very formal speech where this grammar structure is seen in the spoken language. As this is mainly \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, the frequency of any verb in this is determined by the refinement and formality of the language used. For instance, the Bible has a plethora of examples of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u4e8b\u3092\u4e3b\u306b\u9858\u3063\u305f\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u304e\u308a\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u5bb6\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u3046\u308b\u308f\u3057\u304d\u3092\u898b\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5bae\u3067\u5c0b\u306d\u304d\u308f\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3002 I desired one thing from the Lord; that I sought.

Verbs and adjectives may be used in this way. It sounds more refined, and is often used in songs and poems. \u672c\u3092\uff5b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u30fb\u8aad\u307f\uff5d\u3001\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3002 To think awhile from reading a book. \u8857\u4e2d\u306f\u4eba\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\uff08\u3066\uff09\u3001\u305f\u307e\u306b\u8eca\u304c\u901a\u308a\u904e\u304e\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002 There were few people downtown and cars only occasionally passed by. However, to truly investigate the interchangeability of the two, you need to know what \u3066 does and then see if there are any usages that can\u2019t be expressed with the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \uff5e\u3066, can be used to show successive action, ancillary/incidental conditions, cause/reason, and parallelism. The points of contingency involve ancillary conditions and cause/reason. a. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e\u3066\u3001\u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3007 b. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e, \u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3000\u3007/? a. \u5ea7\u3063\u3066\u8a71\u3059\u3002\u3007 b. \u5ea7\u308a\u3001\u8a71\u3059\u3002X In the first example, not using \u3066 means not establishing a cause-effect relationship. Rather, you end up just showing successive action. Although using the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 for showing successive action, it causes the sentence to sound very segmented, which may very well be how you want to express something, which can be seen in the first example. Though, in more spoken statements, it is more natural to mix it with \u3066. \u904e\u53bb\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u3001\u8077\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3001\u793e\u54e1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u79c1\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u306f\u7acb\u6d3e\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 I forgot the past, I looked for a job, I became a company employee, and my way of life became amazing. \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306f\u96d1\u8a8c\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u98f2\u3093\u3067\u3001\u51fa\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002 My mother read a magazine, drank coffee, and left.

This is the case because \u3066 borders sounding like it shows a contrast. To keep \u3067\u3042\u3063\u3066, it would have been best to have a just as equally complex latter clause that balances out the meaning of the first. The use of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 has no such problem and nicely segments the two properties in a formal fashion. \u592a\u80a1\u3075\u3068\u3082\u3082\u306e\u4e0a\u3067\u63e1\u308a\u62f3\u3053\u3076\u3057\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u4fe1\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u5207\u306a\u3044\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3067\u3001\u4e0a\u76ee\u9063\u3046\u308f\u3081\u3065\u304b\u3044\u306b\u4e0a\u53f8\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3002 Nobuto, who had made a fist on top her thighs, looked with an upward glance and saddened emotion at her boss.

July 19th, 4:20 It has been found out through police investigation that in the case in which a 16 year old girl and 6 men and women acquaintances from Hiroshima City were arrested for the abandonment of the body of a former classmate in the mountains of Hiroshima Prefecture Kure City, a group of 7 people inside a car towards the mountainside suppressed the former classmate, and repeatedly assaulted her. The police are furthering investigation into the suspicion that [the group] had taken the former student into the car with plans to assault her from the beginning. This month on the 14th, a 16 year old girl who surrendered herself to police for the abandonment of the body in the mountains of Hiroshima Prefecture Kure City of a former 16 year old female student at [their] vocational high school was arrested, and on the 17th, unemployed 21 year old resident of Tottori Prefecture Yurihama Town Seto Ohira and 5 unemployed 16 year old men and women were arrested for suspicion in the body abandonment. Suspect Ohira denies claims from the police, but the 6 others have confessed. In investigation up to now, it\u2019s understood that the 7 people are testifying that they put the former classmate into the vehicle, went to the scene in the mountains, and after getting off the vehicle, they group assaulted [her], and the police on the 18th seized the car thought to be used. In police investigation afterward, it has been found out from reports to the police that the group of 7 suppressed the former classmate inside the car towards the scene and repeatedly assaulted her by beating and kicking her. In light of the the continuation of assault to their former classmate inside the vehicle before having reached the mountains, the police are furthering investigation into the charge that [the group] had brought the former student in the vehicle with plans to assault from the beginning.

Though more common in literature, due to the fact that they are two more verbs, \u898b\u308b, \u5bdd\u308b, and \u6765\u308b are not near as common in this. This, though, is keeping in mind mediums such as very formal speech where this grammar structure is seen in the spoken language. As this is mainly \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, the frequency of any verb in this is determined by the refinement and formality of the language used. For instance, the Bible has a plethora of examples of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u4e8b\u3092\u4e3b\u306b\u9858\u3063\u305f\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u304e\u308a\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u5bb6\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u3046\u308b\u308f\u3057\u304d\u3092\u898b\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5bae\u3067\u5c0b\u306d\u304d\u308f\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3002 I desired one thing from the Lord; that I sought.

Verbs and adjectives may be used in this way. It sounds more refined, and is often used in songs and poems. \u672c\u3092\uff5b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u30fb\u8aad\u307f\uff5d\u3001\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3002 To think awhile from reading a book. \u8857\u4e2d\u306f\u4eba\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\uff08\u3066\uff09\u3001\u305f\u307e\u306b\u8eca\u304c\u901a\u308a\u904e\u304e\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002 There were few people downtown and cars only occasionally passed by. However, to truly investigate the interchangeability of the two, you need to know what \u3066 does and then see if there are any usages that can\u2019t be expressed with the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \uff5e\u3066, can be used to show successive action, ancillary/incidental conditions, cause/reason, and parallelism.

Rather, you end up just showing successive action. Although using the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 for showing successive action, it causes the sentence to sound very segmented, which may very well be how you want to express something, which can be seen in the first example. Though, in more spoken statements, it is more natural to mix it with \u3066. \u904e\u53bb\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u3001\u8077\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3001\u793e\u54e1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u79c1\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u306f\u7acb\u6d3e\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 I forgot the past, I looked for a job, I became a company employee, and my way of life became amazing. \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306f\u96d1\u8a8c\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u98f2\u3093\u3067\u3001\u51fa\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002 My mother read a magazine, drank coffee, and left.
