Perhaps you are speaking to a friend, family member, or a friendly first-name-basis type of acquaintance. In these cases, we can imagine that the speaker and listener's personal space bubbles overlap like a Venn diagram, and an entire conversation can take place within their shared personal space.</p> <p>When \u3060 is used in casual conversations, it is frequently paired with conversational particles like \u3088 and \u306d.

(Translation by Megan Backus.)</p> <p>Yoshimoto mainly uses \u3060 style in this novel, but she switches to \u3067\u3059 style in the second sentence to make the reader feel as though the character is stepping out of the story momentarily to directly address the reader. This adds a feeling of sudden interaction with the reader, which is nearly impossible to reflect in the English translation.</p> <p>Authors use these style-mixing techniques in a range of creative writing genres, from essays and editorials to advertisements and newspaper columns. Even in expository writing such as textbooks, guide books, or blog posts, you may notice that style mixing is used to make the writing more impactful and engaging.</p>"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#social-media-posts","title":"SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS","text":"<p>In fact, most native Japanese speakers use style mixture to some extent, and social media posts are a great example of this. \u6628\u65e5\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3067\u3059</p> <p>\u6e80\u958b\u306e\u82b1\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u30fc Here's a picture of a rhododendron that I took yesterday.

If the message is self-directed and your main purpose is expressing your thoughts or feelings, then \u3060 is your ticket.
