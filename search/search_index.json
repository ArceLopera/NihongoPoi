Japanese writing can be divided into two major styles, often called: \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style and \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059 shows engagement with social rules and therefore directs the writing specifically toward the reader. The \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can be equated with that of \u3060 in speaking, though its impact varies dramatically according to the level of formality. This fits in with the idea that \u3060 is \"raw\" and can therefore be used to show naked emotions and bare facts alike, without the sense of social etiquette that is part and parcel of \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. If we delve a little deeper, \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can also be broken down further into two distinct styles. With impeccable logic, these two styles are known as \u3060 style and\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u3067\u3042\u308b style. They are often treated as one and the same because they come under the umbrella of \u3060 for self-expression, implying a lack of focus on the audience. When we make \u3060 statements, we are stepping away from the need to perform in a socially calculated way, and instead we emphasize our personal thoughts and feelings. In other words, \u3060 statements allow us to avoid considering our relative social status compared to our listeners' because the statement is conceptually staying inside our personal space. In the safety of our bubble, \u3060 statements do not necessarily require a response. This enables us to devote all of our attention to self-expression. When it comes to actual writing styles, however, \u3060 style and \u3067\u3042\u308b style are usually considered separate as they carry different nuances. To put it simply, \u3060 is plain and \u3067\u3042\u308b is a bit more authoritative and formal. For that reason, \u3060 style is usually referred to as plain style, and \u3067\u3042\u308b style is referred to variously in textbooks as plain-formal, literary, or expository style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style remains one set, referred to as polite style. Examples of nuances: \u3060 FOR EMPHATIC SELF-EXPRESSION Statements that end in \u3060 can be used to express thoughts and feelings that arise suddenly or powerfully within us. These kinds of statements are self-directed, and thus we can imagine that they remain inside our personal space bubbles when we say them. Contrary to what you may have learned in textbooks, \u3060 is commonly used to express your inner state when speaking in the presence of someone to whom you'd usually use a more polite speech style like \u3067\u3059 and \u307e\u3059. This is because your use of \u3060 communicates that the purpose of the statement is self-expression and not actually directed at the listener, even if they are within earshot. \u3060 FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM There are some cases where it is not clear whether a \u3060 statement should be considered self-directed or directed at others. For these examples, we think it is useful to imagine that the speaker's personal space bubble has expanded to include the listeners inside of it. \u706b\u4e8b\u3060\uff01 \u3060 FOR INVADING PERSONAL SPACE When \u3060 statements that carry a negative emotion or message are directed at a specific listener, \u3060 adds an aggressive and assertive feeling. In this case, the listener may feel surprised, affronted, or threatened by the statement. For this reason, we refer to this use of \u3060 as \"invasive.\" \u3046\u305d\u3060\uff01 While this statement is clearly motivated by the actions of a particular person, the use of \u3060 suggests that the statement is not intended to engage the listener in discussion. While it is directed at the speaker in the sense that it is intended to have an impact, it is stripped of all feelings of social responsibility or concern for the other person's point of view. The purpose is to express the speaker's outrage, not to start a conversation. The one-sided nature of this statement is what gives it an assertive, or even confrontational, feeling. \u3060 IN CASUAL CONVERSATION While the uses of \u3060 we've discussed thus far seem to be directed at the speaker themselves, there are also cases where we use \u3060 statements that are clearly directed at others. In these cases, \u3060 is used because the listener is considered close enough to the speaker that their relative social statuses are not relevant or worth paying attention to by using \u3067\u3059. Perhaps you are speaking to a friend, family member, or a friendly first-name-basis type of acquaintance. In these cases, we can imagine that the speaker and listener's personal space bubbles overlap like a Venn diagram, and an entire conversation can take place within their shared personal space. When \u3060 is used in casual conversations, it is frequently paired with conversational particles like \u3088 and \u306d. Remember that when \u3060 is used alone it can convey a feeling of strong emotion? Well, our particle friends help to make the statement sound softer and more interactional. A: \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088\u3002(Hey, we have an exam tomorrow.) B: \u3048\uff01\uff1f( What!?) A: \u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u5fb9\u591c\u3060\u306d\u3002(It's gonna be an all-nighter for you.) For example, by saying \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088, you are reminding the listener of the test. If this is stated without the particle \u3088, this would sound more like a \u3060 statement intended to express the speaker's sudden remembrance of the test. Similarly, saying \u5fb9\u591c\u3060\u306d allows the speaker to show her empathy while suggesting the listener should study all night. Without the \u306d, this sentence would sound more like a strong command. \u3067\u3059 FOR CREATING DISTANCE using \u3067\u3059 increases the distance between people, which results in their relationship feeling more formal. \u3067\u3059 is part of the \"polite speech style\" in Japanese, along with the \u307e\u3059 form of verbs. This stands in opposition to the \"casual speech style,\" which \u3060 is considered to be a part of. Imagine that you are talking with your senpai at work. He might offer you permission to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3. The word \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3 consists of \u305f\u3081 (equal) and \u304f\u3061 (mouth), and is pronounced as \u305f\u3081\u3050\u3061. As the word suggests, using it indicates that the speaker and listener have equal status. If someone asks you to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3\u3000\u3000\u3050\u3061, it is likely that the person wants to be friends with you. Or \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3 can also be a sign of romantic interest. \u3067\u3059 FOR EMPHASIZING SARCASM When doing this with someone who is usually in your personal space bubble, the listener will feel ejected from the bubble, which can have a comedic, sarcastic effect but can also be perceived as rude or hurtful. Let's explore how this works in real life situations. Imagine a situation where you have a boyfriend who is bragging about getting a whole lot of chocolates from his colleagues on Valentine's Day. Instead of using your energy to complain about his lack of sensitivity, you can say the following sentence, keeping the tone of your voice low for effect. \u3078\u30fc\u3001\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u306d\u30fc\u3002 Saying this in a casual speech form would still communicate your true thoughts, which is that you're not happy about what he told you, if you manipulate the tone of your voice and facial expressions to show sarcasm. But the addition of \u3067\u3059, makes your boyfriend feel you are creating distance between the two of you, and this makes your statement sound even colder. Remember, \u3067\u3059 emphasizes distance and creates certain nuances only when you use it with someone who you normally talk to in casual speech style. \u3067\u3059 FOR STEPPING INTO A DIFFERENT SOCIAL ROLE Another way this distance affects our communication is that it allows speakers to step into a different social role. For example, teachers use polite speech style to address the whole class when talking about something that is relevant to everyone. When they talk to a specific student about something that is relevant only to that student, they are more likely to use casual speech. This is because what they say is more or less personal when they address particular students. When they address the whole class however, teachers tend to use \u3067\u3059 to show that they are now engaged in a social activity they are responsible for. In other words, teachers use \u3067\u3059 to signal that their focus is on the class, and they are well aware of their role as a teacher. ACADEMIC WRITING \u3067\u3042\u308b style is overwhelmingly employed in academic writing, particul arly in published research papers, theses, and dissertations. This is because the information under discussion is objective, rigorous, and intended to be persuasive, making the authoritative and formal tone of \u3067\u3042\u308b fitting in this kind of writing. The \u3067\u3042\u308b style can have a high-and-mighty connotation, so its use as base form is generally limited. So the choice of writing style is more about the text's content and intended audience. \u3067\u3042\u308b style is often used when the text is issued by some sort of authority, whereas plain old \u3060 style is for more neutral and lighter texts. Lighter academic writing exercises such as high school essays, on the other hand, tend to use \u3060 style instead. Official documents, such as government reports and policy documents, are also primarily written in \u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style is often associated with simple, easy-to-read instructions or guidelines addressing the reader directly. So even in formal writing, if information is portrayed as being directed toward the reader, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style will almost always be favored. NEWS MEDIA The purpose of news media is to convey information in a purely objective manner without the sense that this information carries authority. Here, \u3060 style is usually preferred over \u3067\u3042\u308b style to reflect the ideal that journalists should maintain a neutral voice in their writing, rather than trying to persuade the reader of their point of view. In editorials and other pieces that are addressing the reader directly, \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style can be used. Other styles, including \u3067\u3042\u308b or very casual styles, can also be mixed in strategically to spice up writing and convey various nuances and different personas. Not all news media outlets follow these general principles, however. While most online newspapers use \u3060 style for fact reporting, NHK News Web has opted for \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. There are two possible reasons for this choice. Unlike newspapers, NHK doesn't have a print edition, and so it doesn't have to work within a limited space. That means they can freely address readers directly and politely by using \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 to make their articles more accessible and sound friendly. Another explanation could be that NHK is first and foremost a broadcaster, which might have influenced their choice of a more \"spoken\" style. CREATIVE WRITING Creative writers tend to select one style as the prominent voice in their writing. However, they can intentionally mix in other styles to add different effects. The following is an excerpt from Banana Yoshimoto's critically acclaimed novel, Kitchen. \u3057\u3093\u3068\u6697\u304f\u3001\u306a\u306b\u3082\u606f\u3065\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u898b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306f\u305a\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3001\u307e\u308b\u3067\u305d\u3063\u307d\u3092\u3080\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u3088\u308a\u306f\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3068\u544a\u3052\u3066\u629c\u304d\u8db3\u3067\u5165\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002 Cold and dark, not a sigh to be heard. Everything there, which should have been so familiar, seemed to be turning away from me. I entered gingerly, on tiptoe, feeling as though I should ask permission. (Translation by Megan Backus.) Yoshimoto mainly uses \u3060 style in this novel, but she switches to \u3067\u3059 style in the second sentence to make the reader feel as though the character is stepping out of the story momentarily to directly address the reader. This adds a feeling of sudden interaction with the reader, which is nearly impossible to reflect in the English translation. Authors use these style-mixing techniques in a range of creative writing genres, from essays and editorials to advertisements and newspaper columns. Even in expository writing such as textbooks, guide books, or blog posts, you may notice that style mixing is used to make the writing more impactful and engaging. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS In fact, most native Japanese speakers use style mixture to some extent, and social media posts are a great example of this. \u6628\u65e5\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3067\u3059 \u6e80\u958b\u306e\u82b1\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304d\u308c\u3044\u3060\u30fc Here's a picture of a rhododendron that I took yesterday.

Then, in the second sentence, the style switches to casual to express the writer's inner thoughts, admiring the beauty of the flowers in full bloom. Social media posts are often loaded with style mixing, as people can freely weave their thoughts in a message to their followers. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059\u4f53 \u3060\u4f53 \u3067\u3042\u308b\u4f53 (\u306f\u304c\u304d\u3001\u3066\u304c\u307f) (\u65e5\u8a18) (\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u8a08\u753b\u66f8\u3001\u8ad6\u6587) \u540d\u8a5e \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059 \u5b66\u751f\u3060 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3042\u308b \u306a\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044 \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3057\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3060\u3063\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f \u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u3044\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \u5927\u304d\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u3044 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u3044 \u5927\u304d\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304b\u3063\u305f \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 \u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u52d5\u8a5e \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3059 \u66f8\u304f \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093 \u66f8\u304b\u306a\u3044 \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f \u66f8\u3044\u305f \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f \u66f8\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \u305d\u306e\u307b\u304b\u306e\u3001\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u5f62 \u8aac\u660e\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046 \u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3088\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u308d\u3046 \u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308d\u3046 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3060 \u554f\u984c\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b \u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u6559\u3048\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044 Basic concepts of \u3067\u3059 as socially-oriented and \u3060 as self-oriented have remained consistent throughout. The effect that these concepts have on communication can vary depending on context, but underneath it all, their basic meaning remains the same. If the message is self-directed and your main purpose is expressing your thoughts or feelings, then \u3060 is your ticket. If your message is directed toward others and you intend to present information in a socially aware manner, then \u3067\u3059 is probably preferred. Based on Tofugo blogpost","title":"\u3067\u3059\u30fc\u307e\u3059VS\u3060\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#vs-style","text":"Objective: Find out the difference in writing style. Japanese writing can be divided into two major styles, often called: \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style and \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style. \u3067\u3059 shows engagement with social rules and therefore directs the writing specifically toward the reader. The \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can be equated with that of \u3060 in speaking, though its impact varies dramatically according to the level of formality. This fits in with the idea that \u3060 is \"raw\" and can therefore be used to show naked emotions and bare facts alike, without the sense of social etiquette that is part and parcel of \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style. If we delve a little deeper, \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style can also be broken down further into two distinct styles. With impeccable logic, these two styles are known as \u3060 style and\u2014you guessed it\u2014\u3067\u3042\u308b style. They are often treated as one and the same because they come under the umbrella of \u3060 for self-expression, implying a lack of focus on the audience. When we make \u3060 statements, we are stepping away from the need to perform in a socially calculated way, and instead we emphasize our personal thoughts and feelings. In other words, \u3060 statements allow us to avoid considering our relative social status compared to our listeners' because the statement is conceptually staying inside our personal space. In the safety of our bubble, \u3060 statements do not necessarily require a response. This enables us to devote all of our attention to self-expression. When it comes to actual writing styles, however, \u3060 style and \u3067\u3042\u308b style are usually considered separate as they carry different nuances. To put it simply, \u3060 is plain and \u3067\u3042\u308b is a bit more authoritative and formal. For that reason, \u3060 style is usually referred to as plain style, and \u3067\u3042\u308b style is referred to variously in textbooks as plain-formal, literary, or expository style. \u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 style remains one set, referred to as polite style.","title":"\u3067\u3059\u30fb\u307e\u3059 vs \u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b style\uff08\u6587\u4f53\uff09"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#examples-of-nuances","text":"","title":"Examples of nuances:"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#for-emphatic-self-expression","text":"Statements that end in \u3060 can be used to express thoughts and feelings that arise suddenly or powerfully within us.

Contrary to what you may have learned in textbooks, \u3060 is commonly used to express your inner state when speaking in the presence of someone to whom you'd usually use a more polite speech style like \u3067\u3059 and \u307e\u3059. This is because your use of \u3060 communicates that the purpose of the statement is self-expression and not actually directed at the listener, even if they are within earshot.","title":"\u3060 FOR EMPHATIC SELF-EXPRESSION"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#for-sounding-the-alarm","text":"There are some cases where it is not clear whether a \u3060 statement should be considered self-directed or directed at others.

While it is directed at the speaker in the sense that it is intended to have an impact, it is stripped of all feelings of social responsibility or concern for the other person's point of view. The purpose is to express the speaker's outrage, not to start a conversation. The one-sided nature of this statement is what gives it an assertive, or even confrontational, feeling.","title":"\u3060 FOR INVADING PERSONAL SPACE"},{"location":"N3/desu_masuVSda_dearu/#in-casual-conversation","text":"While the uses of \u3060 we've discussed thus far seem to be directed at the speaker themselves, there are also cases where we use \u3060 statements that are clearly directed at others. In these cases, \u3060 is used because the listener is considered close enough to the speaker that their relative social statuses are not relevant or worth paying attention to by using \u3067\u3059. Perhaps you are speaking to a friend, family member, or a friendly first-name-basis type of acquaintance. In these cases, we can imagine that the speaker and listener's personal space bubbles overlap like a Venn diagram, and an entire conversation can take place within their shared personal space. When \u3060 is used in casual conversations, it is frequently paired with conversational particles like \u3088 and \u306d. Remember that when \u3060 is used alone it can convey a feeling of strong emotion? Well, our particle friends help to make the statement sound softer and more interactional. A: \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088\u3002(Hey, we have an exam tomorrow.) B: \u3048\uff01\uff1f( What!?)

For example, by saying \u660e\u65e5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3088, you are reminding the listener of the test. If this is stated without the particle \u3088, this would sound more like a \u3060 statement intended to express the speaker's sudden remembrance of the test. Similarly, saying \u5fb9\u591c\u3060\u306d allows the speaker to show her empathy while suggesting the listener should study all night.

This stands in opposition to the \"casual speech style,\" which \u3060 is considered to be a part of. Imagine that you are talking with your senpai at work. He might offer you permission to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3. The word \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3 consists of \u305f\u3081 (equal) and \u304f\u3061 (mouth), and is pronounced as \u305f\u3081\u3050\u3061.

If someone asks you to use \u30bf\u30e1\u53e3\u3000\u3000\u3050\u3061, it is likely that the person wants to be friends with you.

For example, teachers use polite speech style to address the whole class when talking about something that is relevant to everyone. When they talk to a specific student about something that is relevant only to that student, they are more likely to use casual speech. This is because what they say is more or less personal when they address particular students. When they address the whole class however, teachers tend to use \u3067\u3059 to show that they are now engaged in a social activity they are responsible for.

The \u3067\u3042\u308b style can have a high-and-mighty connotation, so its use as base form is generally limited. So the choice of writing style is more about the text's content and intended audience. \u3067\u3042\u308b style is often used when the text is issued by some sort of authority, whereas plain old \u3060 style is for more neutral and lighter texts.

The effect that these concepts have on communication can vary depending on context, but underneath it all, their basic meaning remains the same.

If your message is directed toward others and you intend to present information in a socially aware manner, then \u3067\u3059 is probably preferred.

However, on the other hand, the kanji writing system was also adapted on top of the already existing spoken Japanese language. This gave birth to two sets of words/compound phrases to say similar things in the language. These are so-called \u6f22\u8a9e (\u304b\u3093\u3054, chinese + language) and \u548c\u8a9e (\u308f\u3054, japanese + language) words. Differences \u6f22\u8a9e words are usually written as kanji compounds and usually read the Chinese way (\u97f3\u8aad\u307f), whereas \u548c\u8a9e words are usually written as single kanji + \u304a\u304f\u308a\u304c\u306a and read the Japanese way (\u8a13\u8aad\u307f), although this is not a hard rule, there are exceptions. A lot of \u6f22\u8a9e verbs take \u3059\u308b and usually have a \u548c\u8a9e counterpart which may or may not have a slightly different meaning. \u6f22\u8a9e \u3059\u308b verbs are usually used in more official situations and sound more fancy/stiff, whereas \u548c\u8a9e words are simpler and easier to the ear. However, it is normal in everyday Japanese speech to use either in equal frequency so both options should be studied and remembered equally.

of politeness, plain(\u666e\u901a\u5f62), polite (\u4e01\u5be7\u5f62), and formal (\u656c\u8a9e keigo). Formal and polite can be combined. For example, for the sentence \"This is a book\", plain plain formal polite polite formal very polite formal \u3053\u308c\u306f\u672c\u3060 kore wa hon da. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u672c\u3067\u3042\u308b kore wa hon dearu. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u672c\u3067\u3059 kore wa hon desu. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u672c\u3067\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059 kore wa hon de arimasu. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u672c\u3067\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059 kore wa hon de gozaimasu. For the difference between the form desu-masu vs da-dearu, check this post . The Japanese language has a system of honorific speech, referred to as keigo (Japanese: \u656c\u8a9e, literally \"respectful language\"), parts of speech that show respect. Their use is mandatory in many social situations. Honorifics in Japanese may be used to emphasize social distance or disparity in rank, or to emphasize social intimacy or similarity in rank. Japanese honorific titles, often simply called honorifics, consist of suffixes and prefixes when referring to others in a conversation. The system is very extensive, having its own special vocabulary and grammatical forms to express various levels of respectful, humble, and polite speech. Types of honorifics Honorifics in Japanese, or keigo (\u656c\u8a9e), fall under three main categories: polite language (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, teineigo); respectful language (\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e, sonkeigo); and humble language (\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e, kenj\u014dgo, or \"modest language\"). Polite language Polite language (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, teineigo) is characterized by the use of the sentence ending \"desu\" and the verb ending \"-masu\" and the use of prefixes such as \"o-\" and \"go-\" towards neutral objects. Television presenters invariably use polite language, and it is the form of the language first taught to most non-native learners of Japanese. Polite language can be used to refer to one's own actions or those of other people. Respectful language Respectful language (\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e, sonkeigo) is a special form or alternative word used when talking about superiors and customers. It is not used to talk about oneself. For example, when a Japanese hairdresser or dentist requests their client to take a seat, they say o kake ni natte kudasai to mean \"please sit down\". However, they would use the verb suwaru \u5ea7 \u3059\u308f \u308b rather than o kake ni naru to refer to themselves sitting down. The respectful version of language can only be used to refer to others. In general, respectful language is directed at those in positions of power; for example, a superior at work, or a customer. It also implies that the speaker is acting in a professional capacity. It is characterized by lengthy polite expressions. Common verbs may be replaced by more polite alternative verbs, for example suru (do) by nasaru, or hanasu (talk) by ossharu when the subject is a person of respect. Some of these transformations are many-to-one: iku (go), kuru (come), and iru (be) all become irassharu, and taberu (eat) and nomu (drink) both become meshiagaru. Verbs may also be changed to respectful forms. One respectful form is a modification of the verb with a prefix and a polite suffix. For example, yomu (read) becomes o-yomi ni naru, with the prefix o- added to the i-form of the verb, and the verb ending ni naru. The verb ending -(r)areru can also be used, such as yomareru. Nouns also undergo substitution to express respect. The normal Japanese word for person hito (\u4eba) becomes kata (\u65b9) in respectful language. Thus, a customer would normally be expected to be referred to as a kata rather than a hito. Humble language In general, humble language is used when describing one's actions or the actions of a person in one's in-group to others such as customers in business. Humble language tends to imply that one's actions are taking place in order to assist the other person. Humble language (\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e, kenj\u014dgo) is similar to respectful language, in substituting verbs with other forms. For example: suru (do) becomes itasu, and morau (receive) becomes itadaku. These two verbs are also seen in set phrases such as d\u014d itashimashite (you're welcome) and itadakimasu (\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\u2014a phrase said before eating or drinking). Similar to respectful language, verbs can also change their form by adding a prefix and the verb \"suru\" or \"itasu\". For example, motsu (carry) becomes o mochi shimasu. The use of humble forms may imply doing something for the other person; thus a Japanese person might offer to carry something for someone else by saying o mochi shimasu. This type of humble form also appears in the set phrase o matase shimashita, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting\", from mataseru (make wait) with the addition of o and shimasu. Similarly, o negai shimasu, \"please [do this]\", from negau (request or hope for), again with the addition of o and shimasu. Even more politely, the form motasete itadaku literally means \"humbly be allowed to carry\". This phrase would be used to express the idea that \"I will carry it if you please.\" In humble language, name suffixes are dropped when referring to people from inside one's group.

This distinction between groups is a fundamental part of Japanese social custom and sociolinguistics and is even directly reflected in the Japanese language itself. The basic concept revolves around dividing people into in-groups and out-groups. When speaking with someone from an out-group, the out-group must be honored, and the in-group humbled. That is achieved with special features of the Japanese language, which conjugates verbs based on both tense and politeness. It may also include social concepts such as gift giving or serving. The uchi\u2013soto relationship can lead to someone making great personal sacrifices to honor a visitor or other person in an out-group. One of the complexities of the uchi\u2013soto relationship lies in the fact that groups are not static; they may overlap and change over time and according to situation. Uchi\u2013soto groups may be conceptualized as a series of overlapping circles. One's position within the group and relative to other groups depends on the context, situation, and time of life. For example, a person usually has a family, a job, and other groups or organizations to which they belong. Their position within the various groups and in relation to other groups changes according to circumstances at a given moment. Japanese honorific language (\"keigo\") is divided into three forms: polite, humble and respectful. Within these forms are specific words and prefixes. For example, the verb \"to eat\" may be given as follows: taberu (plain: \"I/we/you/they eat\" or \"he/she/it eats\") itadaku (humble, literally \"to receive\", used to refer to oneself or one's in-group) meshiagaru (respectful, used to refer to one's superior)","title":"Basic"},{"location":"N3/keigo-intro/#types-of-honorifics","text":"Honorifics in Japanese, or keigo (\u656c\u8a9e), fall under three main categories: polite language (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, teineigo); respectful language (\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e, sonkeigo); and humble language (\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e, kenj\u014dgo, or \"modest language\").","title":"Types of honorifics"},{"location":"N3/keigo-intro/#polite-language","text":"Polite language (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e, teineigo) is characterized by the use of the sentence ending \"desu\" and the verb ending \"-masu\" and the use of prefixes such as \"o-\" and \"go-\" towards neutral objects. Television presenters invariably use polite language, and it is the form of the language first taught to most non-native learners of Japanese. Polite language can be used to refer to one's own actions or those of other people.","title":"Polite language"},{"location":"N3/keigo-intro/#respectful-language","text":"Respectful language (\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e, sonkeigo) is a special form or alternative word used when talking about superiors and customers. It is not used to talk about oneself. For example, when a Japanese hairdresser or dentist requests their client to take a seat, they say o kake ni natte kudasai to mean \"please sit down\". However, they would use the verb suwaru \u5ea7 \u3059\u308f \u308b rather than o kake ni naru to refer to themselves sitting down. The respectful version of language can only be used to refer to others. In general, respectful language is directed at those in positions of power; for example, a superior at work, or a customer. It also implies that the speaker is acting in a professional capacity. It is characterized by lengthy polite expressions. Common verbs may be replaced by more polite alternative verbs, for example suru (do) by nasaru, or hanasu (talk) by ossharu when the subject is a person of respect. Some of these transformations are many-to-one: iku (go), kuru (come), and iru (be) all become irassharu, and taberu (eat) and nomu (drink) both become meshiagaru. Verbs may also be changed to respectful forms. One respectful form is a modification of the verb with a prefix and a polite suffix. For example, yomu (read) becomes o-yomi ni naru, with the prefix o- added to the i-form of the verb, and the verb ending ni naru. The verb ending -(r)areru can also be used, such as yomareru. Nouns also undergo substitution to express respect. The normal Japanese word for person hito (\u4eba) becomes kata (\u65b9) in respectful language. Thus, a customer would normally be expected to be referred to as a kata rather than a hito.","title":"Respectful language"},{"location":"N3/keigo-intro/#humble-language","text":"In general, humble language is used when describing one's actions or the actions of a person in one's in-group to others such as customers in business. Humble language tends to imply that one's actions are taking place in order to assist the other person. Humble language (\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e, kenj\u014dgo) is similar to respectful language, in substituting verbs with other forms. For example: suru (do) becomes itasu, and morau (receive) becomes itadaku. These two verbs are also seen in set phrases such as d\u014d itashimashite (you're welcome) and itadakimasu (\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\u2014a phrase said before eating or drinking). Similar to respectful language, verbs can also change their form by adding a prefix and the verb \"suru\" or \"itasu\". For example, motsu (carry) becomes o mochi shimasu. The use of humble forms may imply doing something for the other person; thus a Japanese person might offer to carry something for someone else by saying o mochi shimasu. This type of humble form also appears in the set phrase o matase shimashita, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting\", from mataseru (make wait) with the addition of o and shimasu. Similarly, o negai shimasu, \"please [do this]\", from negau (request or hope for), again with the addition of o and shimasu. Even more politely, the form motasete itadaku literally means \"humbly be allowed to carry\". This phrase would be used to express the idea that \"I will carry it if you please.\" In humble language, name suffixes are dropped when referring to people from inside one's group. Thus, Japanese-speaking company executives would introduce themselves and their team by saying \"I am Gushiken, the president, and this is Niwa, the CEO.\" Similarly to respectful language, nouns can also change. The word hito (\u4eba), meaning \"person\", becomes mono (\u8005).

This is when you use the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 but attach nothing to it, and in doing so, it functions like the particle \u3066. This was in fact the original way. However, no two methods in Japanese evolve without differences emerging as well. The \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 One of the first problems with using the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 is that most learners don't know what it is. Even though by now you should know exactly what it is, here is a reminder. Class Example \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 \u9023\u7528\u5f62 \u4e00\u6bb5 \u898b\u308b \u898b\u308b \u898b \u4e94\u6bb5 \u52dd\u3064 \u52dd\u3064 \u52dd\u3061 \u30b5\u5909 \u3059\u308b \u3059\u308b \u3057 \u30ab\u5909 \u6765\u308b \u6765\u308b \u6765 \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \u5c11\u306a\u3044 \u5c11\u306a\u3044 \u5c11\u306a\u304f \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e \u7c21\u5358\u3060 \u7c21\u5358\u3060 \u7c21\u5358\u3067\uff08\u3042\u308a\uff09 When you use \u3044\u308b in this grammatical pattern, you have to use \u304a\u308a, which is the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of its humble form \u304a\u308b. You should not use the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 \u3044. However, in older works, you do find \uff5e\u3066\u3044 instead of \uff5e\u3066\u304a\u308a. \u307e\u305f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306b\uff11\uff18\u4e07\u4eba\u304c\u4f4f\u307e\u3044\u3092\u8ffd\u308f\u308c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u3046\u3061\uff17\u4e07\uff15\uff10\uff10\uff10\u4eba\u304c\u5404\u5730\u306b\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u9023\u306e\uff30\uff2b\uff2f\uff1d\u5e73\u548c\u7dad\u6301\u6d3b\u52d5\u306e\u65bd\u8a2d\u306b\u907f\u96e3\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u56fd\u9023\u306f\u5b89\u5168\u306e\u78ba\u4fdd\u3084\u4eba\u9053\u652f\u63f4\u306b\u5168\u529b\u3092\u6319\u3052\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 Also, there have been 180,000 people driven from their dwellings, and of these, 75,000 have evacuated to UN PKO (Peacekeeping Operations) facilities, and the UN are putting all forces to human aid and safety security.

From \u53cb\u60c5 by \u6b66\u8005\u5c0f\u8def\u5b9f\u7be4. Though more common in literature, due to the fact that they are two more verbs, \u898b\u308b, \u5bdd\u308b, and \u6765\u308b are not near as common in this. This, though, is keeping in mind mediums such as very formal speech where this grammar structure is seen in the spoken language. As this is mainly \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, the frequency of any verb in this is determined by the refinement and formality of the language used. For instance, the Bible has a plethora of examples of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u4e8b\u3092\u4e3b\u306b\u9858\u3063\u305f\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u304e\u308a\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u5bb6\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u3046\u308b\u308f\u3057\u304d\u3092\u898b\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5bae\u3067\u5c0b\u306d\u304d\u308f\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3002 I desired one thing from the Lord; that I sought. For as long as I live, may I dwell in the house of the Lord, look upon his beauty, and seek him in his temple. From \u8a69\u7bc7\u3057\u3078\u3093\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e03\u7ae0\u56db\u7bc0 \u53e3\u8a9e\u8a33 Again, instead of \uff5e\u3066, you can just use the \u9023\u7528\u5f62, which is quite literary. Verbs and adjectives may be used in this way. It sounds more refined, and is often used in songs and poems. \u672c\u3092\uff5b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u30fb\u8aad\u307f\uff5d\u3001\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3002 To think awhile from reading a book. \u8857\u4e2d\u306f\u4eba\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\uff08\u3066\uff09\u3001\u305f\u307e\u306b\u8eca\u304c\u901a\u308a\u904e\u304e\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002 There were few people downtown and cars only occasionally passed by. However, to truly investigate the interchangeability of the two, you need to know what \u3066 does and then see if there are any usages that can\u2019t be expressed with the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \uff5e\u3066, can be used to show successive action, ancillary/incidental conditions, cause/reason, and parallelism. The points of contingency involve ancillary conditions and cause/reason. a. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e\u3066\u3001\u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3007 b. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e, \u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3000\u3007/? a. \u5ea7\u3063\u3066\u8a71\u3059\u3002\u3007 b. \u5ea7\u308a\u3001\u8a71\u3059\u3002X In the first example, not using \u3066 means not establishing a cause-effect relationship. Rather, you end up just showing successive action. Although using the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 for showing successive action, it causes the sentence to sound very segmented, which may very well be how you want to express something, which can be seen in the first example. Though, in more spoken statements, it is more natural to mix it with \u3066. \u904e\u53bb\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u3001\u8077\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3001\u793e\u54e1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u79c1\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u306f\u7acb\u6d3e\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 I forgot the past, I looked for a job, I became a company employee, and my way of life became amazing. \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306f\u96d1\u8a8c\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u98f2\u3093\u3067\u3001\u51fa\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002 My mother read a magazine, drank coffee, and left.

This is the case because \u3066 borders sounding like it shows a contrast. To keep \u3067\u3042\u3063\u3066, it would have been best to have a just as equally complex latter clause that balances out the meaning of the first. The use of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 has no such problem and nicely segments the two properties in a formal fashion. \u592a\u80a1\u3075\u3068\u3082\u3082\u306e\u4e0a\u3067\u63e1\u308a\u62f3\u3053\u3076\u3057\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u4fe1\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u5207\u306a\u3044\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3067\u3001\u4e0a\u76ee\u9063\u3046\u308f\u3081\u3065\u304b\u3044\u306b\u4e0a\u53f8\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3002 Nobuto, who had made a fist on top her thighs, looked with an upward glance and saddened emotion at her boss.

However, in older works, you do find \uff5e\u3066\u3044 instead of \uff5e\u3066\u304a\u308a. \u307e\u305f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306b\uff11\uff18\u4e07\u4eba\u304c\u4f4f\u307e\u3044\u3092\u8ffd\u308f\u308c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u3046\u3061\uff17\u4e07\uff15\uff10\uff10\uff10\u4eba\u304c\u5404\u5730\u306b\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u9023\u306e\uff30\uff2b\uff2f\uff1d\u5e73\u548c\u7dad\u6301\u6d3b\u52d5\u306e\u65bd\u8a2d\u306b\u907f\u96e3\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u56fd\u9023\u306f\u5b89\u5168\u306e\u78ba\u4fdd\u3084\u4eba\u9053\u652f\u63f4\u306b\u5168\u529b\u3092\u6319\u3052\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 Also, there have been 180,000 people driven from their dwellings, and of these, 75,000 have evacuated to UN PKO (Peacekeeping Operations) facilities, and the UN are putting all forces to human aid and safety security.

From \u53cb\u60c5 by \u6b66\u8005\u5c0f\u8def\u5b9f\u7be4. Though more common in literature, due to the fact that they are two more verbs, \u898b\u308b, \u5bdd\u308b, and \u6765\u308b are not near as common in this. This, though, is keeping in mind mediums such as very formal speech where this grammar structure is seen in the spoken language. As this is mainly \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, the frequency of any verb in this is determined by the refinement and formality of the language used. For instance, the Bible has a plethora of examples of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u4e8b\u3092\u4e3b\u306b\u9858\u3063\u305f\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3002\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u304e\u308a\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u5bb6\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3001\u4e3b\u306e\u3046\u308b\u308f\u3057\u304d\u3092\u898b\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5bae\u3067\u5c0b\u306d\u304d\u308f\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3002 I desired one thing from the Lord; that I sought. For as long as I live, may I dwell in the house of the Lord, look upon his beauty, and seek him in his temple. From \u8a69\u7bc7\u3057\u3078\u3093\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e03\u7ae0\u56db\u7bc0 \u53e3\u8a9e\u8a33 Again, instead of \uff5e\u3066, you can just use the \u9023\u7528\u5f62, which is quite literary. Verbs and adjectives may be used in this way. It sounds more refined, and is often used in songs and poems. \u672c\u3092\uff5b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u30fb\u8aad\u307f\uff5d\u3001\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3002 To think awhile from reading a book. \u8857\u4e2d\u306f\u4eba\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\uff08\u3066\uff09\u3001\u305f\u307e\u306b\u8eca\u304c\u901a\u308a\u904e\u304e\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002 There were few people downtown and cars only occasionally passed by. However, to truly investigate the interchangeability of the two, you need to know what \u3066 does and then see if there are any usages that can\u2019t be expressed with the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. \uff5e\u3066, can be used to show successive action, ancillary/incidental conditions, cause/reason, and parallelism. The points of contingency involve ancillary conditions and cause/reason. a. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e\u3066\u3001\u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3007 b. \u98df\u3079\u3059\u304e, \u304a\u8179\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3002\u3000\u3007/? a. \u5ea7\u3063\u3066\u8a71\u3059\u3002\u3007 b. \u5ea7\u308a\u3001\u8a71\u3059\u3002X In the first example, not using \u3066 means not establishing a cause-effect relationship. Rather, you end up just showing successive action. Although using the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 for showing successive action, it causes the sentence to sound very segmented, which may very well be how you want to express something, which can be seen in the first example. Though, in more spoken statements, it is more natural to mix it with \u3066. \u904e\u53bb\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u3001\u8077\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3001\u793e\u54e1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u79c1\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u306f\u7acb\u6d3e\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 I forgot the past, I looked for a job, I became a company employee, and my way of life became amazing. \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u306f\u96d1\u8a8c\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u98f2\u3093\u3067\u3001\u51fa\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002 My mother read a magazine, drank coffee, and left. Consider the following bad sentence where \u3066 is the problem rather than the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62. a. \u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u306b\u521d\u3081\u3066\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u6587\u5316\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u7e04\u6587\u4eba\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3082\u3093\u3058\u3093\u306f\u72e9\u4eba\u304b\u308a\u3085\u3046\u3069\u3067\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3001\u6f01\u592b\u304e\u3087\u3075\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002X b. \u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u306b\u521d\u3081\u3066\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u6587\u5316\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u7e04\u6587\u4eba\u306f\u72e9\u4eba\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6f01\u592b\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3007 The Jomon people who were the first in the Japanese islands to first form their own culture were farmers and fishermen. This is the case because \u3066 borders sounding like it shows a contrast. To keep \u3067\u3042\u3063\u3066, it would have been best to have a just as equally complex latter clause that balances out the meaning of the first. The use of the \u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f62 has no such problem and nicely segments the two properties in a formal fashion. \u592a\u80a1\u3075\u3068\u3082\u3082\u306e\u4e0a\u3067\u63e1\u308a\u62f3\u3053\u3076\u3057\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u4fe1\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u5207\u306a\u3044\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3067\u3001\u4e0a\u76ee\u9063\u3046\u308f\u3081\u3065\u304b\u3044\u306b\u4e0a\u53f8\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3002 Nobuto, who had made a fist on top her thighs, looked with an upward glance and saddened emotion at her boss.

It's often used for specific places like a city, state, or prefecture, rather than a country. For example, Mami was born in Osaka, and now lives in Canada. But she spent most of her life in Nara, so she says \" \u5948 \u306a \u826f \u3089 \u770c \u3051\u3093 \u306e \u51fa \u3057\u3085\u3063 \u8eab \u3057\u3093 \u3067\u3059\u3002\" or \" \u51fa\u8eab\u306f\u5948\u826f\u770c\u3067\u3059\u3002\" The verb mairu \u53c2 \u307e\u3044 \u308b is a more humble form of kuru \u6765\u308b or iku \u884c\u304f.

If you want to get extra polite with any of these sentences, swap out \u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 with shiteorimasu \u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059.
